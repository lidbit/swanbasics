            <h2>Importance of manners</h2>
            <p>As we twirl towards the end of yet another year it is a good time to pause and consider the year we left behind.</p>

            <p>I have come across an interesting quote today:</p><blockquote> &ldquo;The hardest job kids face today is learning good manners without seeing any.&rdquo;<br><i>Fred Astaire</i></blockquote>
            <p>This did cast my mind to this sunday and a flushed and agitated child interupting yet another fight in the car telling us how rude we have been not to say thank you to each other <em>&ldquo;this whole weekend&rdquo;</em>! Sometimes it is the children that prompt us to be better. Challenge, extend, learn and bridge that gap between the expenctation we have of our selfs and the actual reality.</p>
