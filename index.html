            <p>As we twirl towards the end of yet another year it is a good time to pause and consider the year we left behind. <br>I have come across an interesting quote today:<br><b> &ldquo;The hardest job kids face today is learning good manners without seeing any.&rdquo;</b><br><i>Fred Astaire</i><br>This did cast my mind to this sunday and a flushed and agitated child interupting yet another fight in the car telling us how rude we have been not to say thank you to each other <em>t&ldquo;his whole weekend&rdquo;</em>! Sometimes is is the children that propmt us to be better. Challenge, extend, learn and bridge that gap between the expenctation we have of our selfs and the actual reality.</p>
